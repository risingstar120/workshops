**Words of advice:**

  - If you haven't coded a gradient descent from scratch before you should really try.
  - If you can, join the University of Washington's regression course reference above, it's really good. If you can't afford it, try "audit the course" button or apply for the financial aid to enroll
  - If you like phyiscal books, start with the reference books above, you don't really have to buy them if you're residing locally, the national library board (in Singapore) have most them. If not you can download the NLB app and recommend the librarians to get it. =)
