**Words of advice:**

  - If you haven't coded a gradient descent from scratch before you should really try.
  - If you can, join the University of Washington's regression course reference above, it's really good. If you can't afford it, try "audit the course" button or apply for the financial aid to enroll
  - If you like phyiscal books, start with the reference books above, you don't really have to buy them if you're residing locally, the national library board (in Singapore) have most them. If not you can download the NLB app and recommend the librarians to get it. =)

**Words of advice:**

 - Best help on the framework you get would be the dev-users communication channels that are in place for the specific frameworks
   - [PyTorch] https://discuss.pytorch.org/
   - [Tensorflow/Keras] https://www.tensorflow.org/community/ (mainly stackoverflow, just tag your question with `tensorflow` tag)
 - Knowing tensorboard will get you far, do take a look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBbEDRsCmv4
 - The Udacity tutorials in the references above are great start to the frameworks, investing time in them will save you time learning the way of the hard knocks later.
