What is this list of materials? 
====

There are many bootcamps and coding courses on data science and machine/deep learing. This list contains links to free resources for specific topics that often comes up in these courses/bootcamps. 

Why create this list of materials?
====

We at Data Science Singapore believe in self-learning. In the Data Science (DS) or Machine Learning (ML) field, most often the best knowledge you get is learnt from authentic conferences, unversity materials, open source documentations/forums and a tonne of resources online that are freely available. 

Technology, esp. machine/deep learning moves really fast. Thus, many researchers are "online-educated" about deep learning. In fact, I can boldly say that the practitioners following Andrew Ng, Jeremy Howard and the likes are MOOC educated. 

Hopefully, this list would serve the Data Science SG community as a gauge of whether it's enough for you to simply go through some of the materials linked to topics before one decides to spend on bootcamps and coding courses. Many times it's not the learning materials or code that's important but the journey of learning and self-exploration that's important to understand and implement the concepts. For some, a simple lead from this list is sufficient to spark a journey of continuous self-learning =)

Simply navigate to https://github.com/datasciencesg/workshops/tree/master/LearnItYourself/Beginners

**Note:** We only have the beginner topics ready for now. But do also note that while some courses/bootcamps might think that some topics are advance, we might have them in the beginner topics.
