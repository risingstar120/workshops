What is this list of materials? 
====

There are many bootcamps and coding courses on data science and machine/deep learning. This list contains links to FREE (at moment of addition) resources for specific topics that often comes up in these courses/bootcamps. 

Why create this list of materials?
====

We at DataScience SG (DSSG) believes everyone has their preferred learning methods. In the Data Science (DS), Machine Learning (ML) field or if you choose to Artificial Intelligence (AI), most often the knowledge, from basic to cutting edge, can be learnt from technical conferences, university materials, open source documentations/forums and more. These resources are online, freely available and can be found by the passionate. DSSG put up these materials to help individuals understand what's needed for DataScience and Artificial Intelligence. They can use these free knowledge gained to choose suitable workshops / learning paths for themselves. There are great paid workshops, we hope these list can help you identify them.

Technology, esp. machine/deep learning moves really fast. By our observations, many practitioners are "online-educated". In fact,we can boldly say that most practitioners following Andrew Ng, Jeremy Howard, Yoshua Bengio, Ian Goodfellow, Geoffrey Hinton and the likes are MOOC/online-educated. 

Hopefully, this list would serve the DSSG community as a gauge on whether it's enough for you to simply go through the materials linked to topics or decides to SPEND on bootcamps and coding courses. We understand that some of them are free, but they will definitely require you to take time away from family and friends, so its best to select carefully. 

Many times it's not the learning materials or code that's important but the journey of learning and self-exploration that's important, through understanding and implementing the concepts. For some, a simple lead from this list is sufficient to spark a journey of continuous self-learning =)

**Note:** We only have the beginner topics ready for now. But do also note that while some courses/bootcamps might think that some topics are advance, we might have them in the beginner topics.
